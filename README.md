# bubble-sort

Visualisation of bubble sort using a 2D array of initially random colours, then
sorting by different rules on each axis. 

Controls:
 - left click and drag to increase rate of swaps
 - right click and drag to decrease rate of swaps
 - f to print current frame rate
 - s to print current swaps per tick

Future developments:
 - start with perfect gradient of colours then shuffle instead of random colours
 - add a 2D swap system instead of two 1D swap systems which is sometimes suboptimal
 - stop increasing rate of swaps when frame rate starts to drop / skip frames to keep same rate
